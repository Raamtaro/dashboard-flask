Steps to run locally:

1. Follow the instructions outlined in this article to install NodeJS https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-installing-node-js (Note that the directions don't include instructions for windows OS, as windows typically isn't well suited to dedicated devloper environments).

2. Open a terminal, and `cd` to the `client` folder of the `dashboard-flask` repo and run `npm install` to create a `node_modules` folder with all relevant dependencies.

3. Start the project via `npm run dev` and visit the localHost shown in the terminal (in response to the run command).
